### 2025-05-10: `chrivers/z2m-new-features`

After the many fundamental and infrastructure changes in Bifrost, it's finally
time for a set of changes that add new features!

This one is particularly exciting, as it contains a number of exciting additions
that directly improve the end-user experience.

Bifrost is now able to:

 - Update existing scenes (closes #85)
 - Delete lights
 - Add new lights to the bridge
 - Add new lights to rooms
 - Remove lights from rooms
 - Make lights pulse when selected
 - Learn scenes with gradient colors

All these actions now work from the api, including directly from the Hue app!

No more jumping back and forth between the app and z2m to perform common
maintenance tasks!
