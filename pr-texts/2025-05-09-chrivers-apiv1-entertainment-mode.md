### 2025-05-09: `chrivers/apiv1-entertainment-mode`

Implement complete support for entertainment zones ("sync mode") for the v1 api, including the obsolete (but apparently still used) streaming v1 api!

This fixes support for at least the following:
 - Philips Ambilight TVs (..ironically)
 - The iLightShow app for streaming blinkenlights

This change also improves logging and error handling related to sync streaming.
