# Bifrost Bridge [DEV VERSION]

Bifrost enables you to emulate a Philips Hue Bridge to control lights, groups
and scenes from [Zigbee2Mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/).

This is the DEVELOPMENT TESTING VERSION.

Please see the regular installation instructions here:

https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost-hassio/tree/master/bifrost

## Installation guide

  1. Install Bifrost Add-on
  2. Configure Bifrost (see next sections)
  3. Start Bifrost Add-on

## Configuring Bifrost

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must configure** bifrost before you can run it.

Bifrost requires a configuration file, `config.yaml`.

This file contains the essential settings needed to run the server. For example,
the IP and MAC address used by the server, and a list of the Zigbee2Mqtt servers
to connect to.

When using the Home Assistant Add-on, the file must be available inside the
docker container as `/config/bifrost/config.yaml`, which means you have to put
it here:

    /usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/bifrost

### If you have the popular "File Editor" add-on installed, do this:

  1. Open "File Editor"
  2. Go to the top level
  3. Create directory `bifrost` (*lowercase*)
  4. Inside that directory, create `config.yaml`

## Configuration example

Here's an example, for a server listening on `10.12.0.20/24`, with a Zigbee2Mqtt
server running on `10.0.0.100`:

```yaml
bridge:
  name: Bifrost
  mac: 00:11:22:33:44:55
  ipaddress: 10.12.0.20
  netmask: 255.255.255.0
  gateway: 10.12.0.1
  timezone: Europe/Copenhagen

z2m:
  server1:
    url: ws://10.0.0.100:8080
```

Please adjust this as needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Make sure** the "mac:" field matches the mac address on the network interface you want to serve requests from.

For details, see the [configuration reference](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/config-reference.md).

This mac address if used to generate a self-signed certificate, so the Hue App
will recognize this as a "real" Hue Bridge. If the mac address is incorrect,
this will not work. [How to find your mac address](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/how-to-find-mac-linux.md).

# F.A.Q

## Will Bifrost work without Zigbee2Mqtt?

Not in the near future. Bifrost is closely integrated with Zigbee2Mqtt, to provide good, reliable performance.

Development is underway to be able to support multiple types of backends at some future
point, but only the z2m backend is being developed.

## Will Bifrost be able to use my switches / motion sensors?

Currently, no. However, Zigbee2Mqtt is able to use these, and it's
absolutely possible to use such devices via e.g. Home Assistant, even while
using Bifrost at the same time to control your lights.

We hope to support switches and motion sensors in a future Bifrost release.

## Will Bifrost ever support the Hue (HDMI) Sync Box, or true Entertainment Mode?

Yes! Work is well underway.

The Bifrost project has acheived several breakthroughs in reverse-engineering
the proprietary Hue Entertainment Mode protocols. This work has been made
possible by your donations, which have been invested in necessary equipment.

The newest `bifrost-dev` add-on is the first version of any Open Source
software, to ever support Entertainment Mode. Please help us test it, and let us
know what you think!

# Donors

I would like to personally thank the people who have helped this project financially.

Your support has resulted in major breakthroughs, and we all get to enjoy the results.

The following people have donated a total of 25€ or more:
  - Alexa & Peter Miller
  - Modem-Tones
  - Rohan Kapoor
  - thk

In particular, I would like to thank Rohan Kapoor for his very generous donation, which
covered the cost of a Hue Sync Box!



# Full changelog

### 2025-04-22: `chrivers/legacy-api-fixes`

This update fixes bugs and adds workarounds for the legacy api.

In particular, this greatly improves compatibility with Hue Essentials, which
now works quite a bit better:

 - Fix brightness scaling: Legacy api uses 0..254, while the new api uses 0..100
 - Fix "group 0" handling: The bridge has a virtual "group 0", which represents all groups on the bridge
 - Add workaround for scenes without `.speed` field (Hue Essentials does this), so we don't get an error

****************************************

### 2025-04-21: `chrivers/z2m-refactoring`

This change cleans up a bunch of internal code related to the z2m backend, and
makes two important user-facing improvement:

#### Status updates
Previously, as part of supporting hue effects (candle, fireplace, etc), we would
encode all light update requests to hue lights as the hue-specific
`HueZigbeeUpdate` data format.

This is the data format a Hue Bridge (mostly) uses to control lights, and is a
quick and effective way to update all light settings at once, even the
vendor-specific extensions.

However, Zigbee2MQTT does not know how to report state updates when this update
method is used. It just sees a "raw" message, and passes it along.

So until we land better support in Zigbee2MQTT for dealing with these kinds of
state updates, split light updates into two parts: one for regular light
properties (on/off, brightness, etc), and one optional part for hue-specific
effects.

The hue-specific update is then only sent if needed and supported.

This makes z2m able to report changes to common properties again, but has the
slight downside of sending two messages, if hue-specific extensions are used.

Hopefully over time this can be simplified, but for now this is an improvement
over the previous situation.

#### Z-Stack entertainment mode fix

Previously, "z-stack" based adaptors did not work with entertainment mode,
because of the way the highly specialized Zigbee frames are constructed.

This update changes how entertainment mode frames are constructed, allowing
adapters in the Z-Stack family to join the fun.



# Now on Ko-fi! Donations welcome :-)

Developing software for the hue ecosystem is a fun, but pretty expensive hobby.

If you would like to toss a few dollaridoos in the hat, I've set up a Ko-fi accont:

[![Link to Ko-Fi donation page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrivers/bifrost-hassio/refs/heads/master/kofi.png)](https://ko-fi.com/L4L819GOTY)

All donations will go towards new equipment for testing and development.
