# Bifrost Bridge [DEV VERSION]

Bifrost enables you to emulate a Philips Hue Bridge to control lights, groups
and scenes from [Zigbee2Mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/).

This is the DEVELOPMENT TESTING VERSION.

Please see the regular installation instructions here:

https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost-hassio/tree/master/bifrost

## Installation guide

  1. Install Bifrost Add-on
  2. Configure Bifrost (see next sections)
  3. Start Bifrost Add-on

## Configuring Bifrost

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must configure** bifrost before you can run it.

Bifrost requires a configuration file, `config.yaml`.

This file contains the essential settings needed to run the server. For example,
the IP and MAC address used by the server, and a list of the Zigbee2Mqtt servers
to connect to.

When using the Home Assistant Add-on, the file must be available inside the
docker container as `/config/bifrost/config.yaml`, which means you have to put
it here:

    /usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/bifrost

### If you have the popular "File Editor" add-on installed, do this:

  1. Open "File Editor"
  2. Go to the top level
  3. Create directory `bifrost` (*lowercase*)
  4. Inside that directory, create `config.yaml`

## Configuration example

Here's an example, for a server listening on `10.12.0.20/24`, with a Zigbee2Mqtt
server running on `10.0.0.100`:

```yaml
bridge:
  name: Bifrost
  mac: 00:11:22:33:44:55
  ipaddress: 10.12.0.20
  netmask: 255.255.255.0
  gateway: 10.12.0.1
  timezone: Europe/Copenhagen

z2m:
  server1:
    url: ws://10.0.0.100:8080
```

Please adjust this as needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Make sure** the "mac:" field matches the mac address on the network interface you want to serve requests from.

For details, see the [configuration reference](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/config-reference.md).

This mac address if used to generate a self-signed certificate, so the Hue App
will recognize this as a "real" Hue Bridge. If the mac address is incorrect,
this will not work. [How to find your mac address](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/how-to-find-mac-linux.md).

# F.A.Q

## Will Bifrost work without Zigbee2Mqtt?

Not in the near future. Bifrost is closely integrated with Zigbee2Mqtt, to provide good, reliable performance.

Development is underway to be able to support multiple types of backends at some future
point, but only the z2m backend is being developed.

## Will Bifrost be able to use my switches / motion sensors?

Currently, no. However, Zigbee2Mqtt is able to use these, and it's
absolutely possible to use such devices via e.g. Home Assistant, even while
using Bifrost at the same time to control your lights.

We hope to support switches and motion sensors in a future Bifrost release.

## Will Bifrost ever support the Hue (HDMI) Sync Box, or true Entertainment Mode?

Yes! Work is well underway.

The Bifrost project has acheived several breakthroughs in reverse-engineering
the proprietary Hue Entertainment Mode protocols. This work has been made
possible by your donations, which have been invested in necessary equipment.

The newest `bifrost-dev` add-on is the first version of any Open Source
software, to ever support Entertainment Mode. Please help us test it, and let us
know what you think!

# Donors

I would like to personally thank the people who have helped this project financially.

Your support has resulted in major breakthroughs, and we all get to enjoy the results.

The following people have donated a total of 25€ or more:
  - Alexa & Peter Miller
  - Modem-Tones
  - Rohan Kapoor
  - thk

In particular, I would like to thank Rohan Kapoor for his very generous donation, which
covered the cost of a Hue Sync Box!



# Full changelog

### 2025-05-04: `chrivers/sync-stream-fixes`

Major rework of entertainment streaming ("sync mode") for Bifrost!

- Now supports both XY and RGB mode
- Fix stream closing on DTLS timeout/disconnect (no longer left lingering in "active" state).
- Improves compatibility with Hue Sync Box
- Add support for configurable streaming fps limit for each z2m backend
- Increase timeout to match Hue Bridge
- Adjust the smoothing factor (fade speed) to match the frame rate!
- ..this smoothing factor adjustment is not even supported by a Hue Bridge! Only Bifrost :-)



# Now on Ko-fi! Donations welcome :-)

Developing software for the hue ecosystem is a fun, but pretty expensive hobby.

If you would like to toss a few dollaridoos in the hat, I've set up a Ko-fi accont:

[![Link to Ko-Fi donation page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrivers/bifrost-hassio/refs/heads/master/kofi.png)](https://ko-fi.com/L4L819GOTY)

All donations will go towards new equipment for testing and development.
