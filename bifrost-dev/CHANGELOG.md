# Changelog

This is the DEVELOPMENT TEST VERSION (not the stable release version).

The development version contains new, experimental and/or incomplete features.

It is intended for advanced users, who want all the features, even if they are
not quite done yet.

The dev version is based on the latest stable version, and includes whatever is
in development at the time.

# Changes

### 2025-04-21: `chrivers/z2m-refactoring`

This change cleans up a bunch of internal code related to the z2m backend, and
makes two important user-facing improvement:

#### Status updates
Previously, as part of supporting hue effects (candle, fireplace, etc), we would
encode all light update requests to hue lights as the hue-specific
`HueZigbeeUpdate` data format.

This is the data format a Hue Bridge (mostly) uses to control lights, and is a
quick and effective way to update all light settings at once, even the
vendor-specific extensions.

However, Zigbee2MQTT does not know how to report state updates when this update
method is used. It just sees a "raw" message, and passes it along.

So until we land better support in Zigbee2MQTT for dealing with these kinds of
state updates, split light updates into two parts: one for regular light
properties (on/off, brightness, etc), and one optional part for hue-specific
effects.

The hue-specific update is then only sent if needed and supported.

This makes z2m able to report changes to common properties again, but has the
slight downside of sending two messages, if hue-specific extensions are used.

Hopefully over time this can be simplified, but for now this is an improvement
over the previous situation.

#### Z-Stack entertainment mode fix

Previously, "z-stack" based adaptors did not work with entertainment mode,
because of the way the highly specialized Zigbee frames are constructed.

This update changes how entertainment mode frames are constructed, allowing
adapters in the Z-Stack family to join the fun.

****************************************

### 2025-04-21: `chrivers/websocket-tls`

Implement support for using TLS with websockets ("wss://" urls)

A few users are reporting that they use TLS for their z2m websockets, and this
has previously not been supported.

With these changes, the z2m websocket urls can be specified as "wss://..."
instead of "ws://..." to enable TLS.

Additionally, a new (optional) z2m per-server config option,
`disable_tls_verify` has been added, to optionally turn TLS verification
off. This is useful for certain testing scenarios, where self-signed
certificates might be used.

****************************************

### 2025-04-21: `chrivers/upnp-description-xml`

Implement support for UPNP and SSDP in Bifrost!

These four-letter scrabble winners are discovery protocols, meant to improve auto-detection by clients.

Previously, Bifrost only supported mDNS - yet another such protocol - which is what most (but not all) clients use.

Specifically, Hue Essentials requires SSDP. Not only that, but Hue Essentials sends broken discovery requests, so special workarounds have had to be implemented to support it.

We still know of at least 1 device that is not yet able to find a Bifrost bridge, even with these improvements.

If you have a similar problem, please let us know.

In any case, this should be a clear improvement in how easy it is to connect to Bifrost.

****************************************

### 2025-03-17: `chrivers/api-v1-hs-color-mode`

Implement support for converting Hue/Saturation ("HS") light updates to modern XY-based values.

This enables support for receiving Hue/Sat light updates over API V1, specifically for `ApiLightStateUpdate` (`PUT` requests for controlling lights).

When such a request is received, it is converted to XY mode, and handled from there.

****************************************

### 2025-03-12: `chrivers/entertainment-reversing`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ***This is the big one people have been waiting for!*** :-)

After spending countless hours reverse-engineering the proprietary Zigbee data
format used by Philips Hue lights for "Entertainment Mode", *even countlesser*
hours have gone into implementing support in Bifrost.

Today, I am proud to announce that Bifrost is the **first program in the world**
to have an entirely Open Source (Free Software) implementation of Hue
Entertainment mode!

This has been a monumental effort. Before starting this work, the Bifrost code
base was about 7200 lines of code. Now, it is over 15000 lines!. In other
words, implementing entertainment mode more than doubled the code base!

I think it's fair to say, that this was more complicated than anticipated.

To make this work at all, the Zigbee2Mqtt project was updated with patches from
myself (@chrivers), @danielhitch, and the author of Zigbee2Mqtt, @koenkk.

Special thanks to @koenkk for taking time out of his busy schedule, to help us
get the necessary bits in place. The new code was first released in version 2.1.1.

> [!WARNING]
> Zigbee2Mqtt MUST BE AT LEAST version 2.1.1 for Entertainment Mode to work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even though version 2.1.1 is the minimum version, version 2.1.3 or greater is
> highly recommended, since some important bugs were fixed after version 2.1.1.

This is the very first of Bifrost that supports Entertainment Mode at all, so
please bear with us while we iron out any bugs or rough edges.

Should work:
 - Creating Entertainment Areas from the Hue App.
 - Updating Entertainment Area settings.
 - Adding lights or 7-segment strips to entertainment areas.
 - Streaming to Entertainment Areas from "Hue Sync for PC" (tested).
 - Streaming to Entertainment Areas from Play HDMI sync box 8K (tested).
 - Streaming to one or more lights.
 - Streaming to a combination of lamps and light strips.

Perhaps working: (please let us know what your experience is!)
 - Adding 3-segment strips to entertainment areas.
 - Adding non-color lights to entertainment areas.
 - Streaming to Entertainment Areas from Play HDMI sync box (older, non-8K version).

Not yet working:
 - Adjusting "stream mode" ("From Device" vs "From Bridge")
 - Adjusting "relative brightness" for lights
 - Streaming in XY color mode (most things seem to use RGB mode)

****************************************

### 2025-03-17: `chrivers/hue-crate-entertainment-mode`

This pull request implements the necessary code in the hue crate, to support decoding and encoding of Hue Entertainment Mode (also known as "Sync mode").

There are two major new areas of support:
 - Encoding and decoding the DTLS stream going to the bridge (from a sync client)
 - Encoding and decoding the specialized Zigbee frames going from the bridge, to the lights.

Especially the latter part builds on the previous work done by the Bifrost project, to reverse engineer the Hue Entertainment zigbee format.

This pull request does not in itself add entertainment mode support to the Bifrost bridge. It only adds required library code needed to implement that support in an upcoming pull request.

****************************************

### 2025-03-16: `chrivers/svc-crate`

Implement a new crate ("svc") to manage rust-based micro-services.

Bifrost consists of a number of "things" running independently, while performing work either on request, on a timer, or some combination of the two.

Synchronizing, coordinating and sharing information between all these various parts of Bifrost, takes up a non-trivial amount of the codebase.

That's why we are introducing a dedicates library (a "crate", in rust terminology) for managing services that implement a standardized interface, specifically, the `Service` trait.

This makes it possible to share start/run/stop handling for all services, as well as more advanced features like policies ("if a service fails, what should happen?"), error handling, dependencies, and liveness checks.

This PR introduces and builds up the "svc" crate, but does not change Bifrost to use it, yet.

****************************************

### 2025-03-16: `chrivers/api-v1-improvements`

This PR combines a number of minor improvements to the Hue V1 api implementation.

 - The virtual "daylight sensor" present in the v1 api is now partially implemented. It is now present in the api output, which is an improvement for programs that expected it to be present, but it does not yet do anything.
 - The virtual "group 0", representing all lights on a bridge, is now implemented for the v1 api.
 - Usernames for api v1 can now be any string, instead of only valid uuids.
 - The "create user" endpoint can now reply with the "client key" needed for Entertainment Mode / Sync streams.
 - The reported capabilities have been increased to report lots of space for activities.

****************************************

### 2025-03-15: `chrivers/hue-and-zcl-crates`

This is one of those pull requests that are almost invisible for end users, but important for the developers of Bifrost.

With this change, several pieces of Bifrost are split out into independent packages ("crates" in rust parlance).

This includes:

 - `crates/zcl`: Zigbee Cluster Library crate. This contains code needed to encode/decode Philips Hue zigbee messages.
 - `crates/hue`: Contains data models and functions needed to work with Philips Hue lights, including color space handling, gradient encodings, and more.

Improving the code this much was a lot of work: 56 commits, adding 1630 lines and removing 265.

New features: None :-P

****************************************

### 2025-03-13: `chrivers/docker-ca-certificates` + `chrivers/dockerfile-update`

This fixes the docker build process for Bifrost, which was accidentally broken
during the rush of recent, big merges coming in.

 - Add missing `libssl-dev` package for compile step
 - Add missing `libssl3` package for runtime container
 - Add missing bind mounts for building bifrost
 - Upgrade rust version for build container
 - Add missing `ca-certificates` package, to make hue api version checking
   function correctly again.

With all these checks, the docker release of Bifrost should be back in a good
state.

****************************************

### 2025-03-12: `chrivers/light-status-and-effects`

After having reverse engineered and documented the proprietary [Hue Zigbee message formats](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/pull/93), we can start using this knowledge in Bifrost.

This change updates the z2m backend, to enable support for all "Hue Effects" as seen in the Hue app.

In other words, effects like "Candle", "Fireplace", "Opal", etc, are now fully supported on Hue lights connected over z2m. Ordinary light updates (for brightness, color, color temperature, etc) are now also controlled over this format, allowing for a faster, more efficient way to control Philips Hue lights.

Since only Philips Hue lights support these vendor-specific Zigbee messages, all other lights will use the traditional code path from previous versions of Bifrost.

****************************************

### 2025-03-11: `chrivers/zigbee-docs`

This merge request introduces significant enhancements to the documentation of the Bifrost project, specifically focusing on the reverse engineering and detailed description of the Hue Zigbee message formats.

1. **New Document: Hue Zigbee Clusters**
    - Added `hue-zigbee-clusters.md`, providing comprehensive information on custom Zigbee messages for Hue devices, focusing on lights.
    - Covers clusters such as Hue Button events, Entertainment zones, Gradients, Effects, and Animations.
    - Includes detailed descriptions of cluster-specific commands and attributes with byte structures and examples.

2. **Entertainment Clusters Documentation**
    - Detailed documentation of the Entertainment cluster (0xFC01), describing commands for updating entertainment zones, synchronizing entertainment zones, retrieving segment mappings, and configuring segments for entertainment mode.
    - Provides byte structures and examples for these commands.

3. **Gradients, Effects, and Animations Clusters**
    - Descriptions of the Gradients, Effects, and Animations cluster (0xFC03), including combined state commands and various attributes.
    - Sample values and descriptions help identify properties supported by different Hue devices.

4. **Enhancements to Existing Documentation**
    - Updated `hue-zigbee-format.md` with clarifications and additional details.
    - Improvements include specifying `zigbee::EffectType`, adding examples for unpacking and packing color coordinates, and refining scaling values for color coordinates.

****************************************

### 2025-03-11: `chrivers/the-big-backend-refactor`

The Big Backend Refactor

Rework the infrastructure of Bifrost, to make a clean separation of Zigbee2Mqtt-specific code into a z2m backend module.

At the same time, a new common interface is defined, that backends must implement.

This opens the door for hypothetically supporting multiple types of backends at some future time. However, Zigbee2Mqtt is still the only supported for now.

****************************************

### 2025-03-11: `chrivers/axum-fixes`

Upgrade to Axum 0.8, and clean up dependencies to avoid unnecessary/duplicate crates.

****************************************

## 2025-03-02: `duvholt/state-version-fix`

Use `get_software_version` when patching bridge version.

This fixes a bug where the hue application disconnects periodically, after a version update.

****************************************

## 2025-02-13: `FabioCanavarro/Add-Docker-Pull-Method`

README: Add Docker pull installation method

****************************************

## 2025-02-13: `waywardmonkeys/reduce-typo-count`

Reduce typo count - big thanks to @waywardmonkeys

****************************************

## 2025-02-04: `chrivers/gradient-support`

Experimental support for gradient light strips!

Helped by generous donations from the community, I have been able to purchase a
hue gradient light strip.

After much work, this is now in a mostly-working state.

Support for this is pretty involved, and requires somewhat complicated math to
do color space conversion between XYZ, XYY and RGB.

Some artifacts are expected, and so far this has only been tested with a single
hue led strip, the LCX005 ("Hue Light Strip for PC").

Feedback very welcome. Please let me know if this works for you, and which
lights you have tried this on :)

****************************************

## 2025-02-04: `chrivers/json-extractor-workaround`

This fixes a recurring problem with poorly-implemented client programs (i.e, not
the Hue app or Home Assistant).

Programs like Free@Home, Hue Essentials and OnSwitch do not consistently send
the correct `Content-Type` headers, causing Bifrost to reject their API requests:

 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/70
 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/69
 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/25

With this change, Bifrost ignores the Content-Type header, and tries to decode
Json whenever that is the expected input format.

****************************************

## 2025-02-01: `FabioCanavarro/add-build-essential-note`

README: Added build-essential note and Bash syntax highlighting for shell commands

****************************************

## 2025-01-29: `duvholt/device-with-slash`

Christian Duvholt is back with another improvement. This merge request adds
support for Zigbee2Mqtt device names with a "/" in them.

****************************************

## 2025-01-29: `chrivers/zigbee-format-doc`

The Bifrost project achieved a breakthrough in understanding the
manufacturer-specific Zigbee protocols used for Philips Hue lights. These are
required for proper gradient strip support, and have now been fully documented
for the first time ever!

****************************************

## 2025-01-26: `duvholt/sse-resume`

Christian Duvholt fixed a long-standing annoyance in Bifrost, by making event
stream able to resume from timestamp.

This improves how quickly the hue app is updating after short breaks (i.e,
turning off your phone screen for a short while).

****************************************

## 2025-01-25: Internal device database

Bifrost now has a built-in table of product data for known hue devices, allowing
it to emulate hue bridges more precisely.

****************************************

## 2025-01-25: Fix for iHueConnect app for iPhone

Discord users Alexa and Peter Miller reported an error with the iPhone app "iHue Connect".

After some research, it was discovered that iHue Connect, for unknown reasons,
sends an invalid api request, before proceeding to start.

By emulating the bridge response to the junk request, the app accepts Bifrost as
a real hue bridge, thus making the app work.

****************************************

## 2025-01-19: Zigbee2mqtt version 2.x support

Zigbee2mqtt version 2.x was released recently. It brings a number of changes,
including stricter requirements for connecting to the websocket.

This version of bifrost has support for z2m 2.x.

Please let us know how it works for you!

****************************************

## 2025-01-19: `duvholt/actions-permissions-fix`

Re-add GitHub Actions permissions block

****************************************

## 2025-01-19: Experimental support for `aarch64` architecture

Thanks to a [contribution from
@duvholt](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/pull/54) bifrost docker images are
now available for `aarch64`. This is the 64-bit ARM architecture, used by
Raspberry Pi and many other Single Board Computers.

Please let us know how Bifrost for ARM works for you!

****************************************

## 2025-01-17: Hue API model and emulation improvements

****************************************

## 2025-01-17: Multiple bug fixes for rare edge cases

Several users reported edge cases in parsing the z2m output. Some of these

Bugs fixed:

 - [Issue 56](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/56) Event loop broke: invalid type: integer 30, expected a string
 - [Issue 51](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/51) Failed to parse critical z2m bridge message on [bridge/devices]
 - [Issue 47](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/47) Possible API breakage with z2m version 2.x

****************************************

## 2025-01-15: Self update

Bifrost now queries the hue firmware update servers (like the hue app does) to learn about the newest hue version number.

This branch implements all the necessary support, and spawns a new server task (background job) that tries to fetch the newest version number every 24 hours.

Once a new version number is found, the state database is automatically patched.

In my local test, the version number was successfully updated as soon as Bifrost started.

The log output looks like this:

```
bifrost[104186]: bifrost::server::updater: Firmware update information expired. Fetching..
bifrost[104186]: reqwest::connect: starting new connection: https://firmware.meethue.com/
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::dns: resolve; host=firmware.meethue.com
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::http: connecting to 34.120.72.74:443
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::http: connected to 34.120.72.74:443
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::pool: pooling idle connection for ("https", firmware.meethue.com)
```

later that second, we see this:

```
bifrost[104186]: bifrost::model::state: Bridge device 37859e65-fdef-5965-8858-bbaef6cf47b8 on older firmware 1.60.1960149090. Updating to 1.68.0
bifrost[104186]: bifrost::model::state: Bridge device 72ca59bc-b9e3-578c-8a7d-e2ce07f3604c on older firmware 1.60.1960149090. Updating to 1.68.0
```

This all happened automatically, and the hue app worked again 👍
